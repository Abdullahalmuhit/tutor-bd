                                	If you have the passion to teach, you will be able to teach well regardless of experience. But still, many parents are looking for tutors with experience in teaching the required subjects. Some require tutors from English medium background. But we believe apart from good results and experience, teaching method is still the most important thing is home tuition.

									<ol>
										<li>Discuss with parents when student is not listening you. If you raise your voice with students they may dislike you. Some parents do not want the tutor to shout with their children.</li>
										<li>Do not change the tuition time unnecessarily. In that case some parents will consider the tutor irresponsible who do not plan his/her time well.</li>
										<li>Develop bonds with the student. Good interaction between tutor and student makes it easier to communicate during classes. Make your student comfortable in your presence so that the student becomes motivated to ask questions during lessons.</li>
										<li>Give the student more opportunities to speak up during lessons. For example, instead of reading the question, ask student to read. It will develop the student's verbal skills and help him/her to understand the question better.</li>
										<li>When the attention of the student is decreasing, tutors must learn to change subjects or give the student a break. A 5 minutes break can take back the attention of a student. On the other hand, if you think a 5 minutes break is too much, you can opt to talk about the student's day at school, promote interaction between yourself and the student.</li>
