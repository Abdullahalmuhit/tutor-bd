                                Learn to pick up clues in your student’s speech that enable you to understand how he is really feeling.  A good listener does not dominate the conversation!

                                Give your full attention to the students. Actively listen to what they are saying, then paraphrase what they have said. This displays your interest in the student's learning process.

                                Use a variety of ways to explain the material and show your enthusiasm. Try to make the material more relevant to the student's life. See if you can present things in a different perspective then they were presented in class.

                                You were chosen for qualities that enable you to be a good tutor and role model.  However, having confidence also means having the courage to admit you don’t know an answer.  Be honest with your student; tell her you’ll need to do your homework– and then follow through.  She/He may actually feel better knowing you’re not perfect (and it is a great opportunity to teach learning skills)
