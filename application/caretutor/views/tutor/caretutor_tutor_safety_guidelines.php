                                	As a single tutor, you need to be prepared to avoid potential incidents. Considering the potential risks and knowing ways to reduce them can make you safe at workplace. Think in advance about the 'what if's?'. The more you will be prepared, the more you will act positively to any situation.
Consider the following issues before meeting up at student's home:-
								</p>
								<p>
									<ol>
										<li>If you get confirmation of any tuition job, please contact by mobile to your prospective student or their parent.</li>
										<li>Take your guardian/cousin/family member with you while heading out to meet the student/parent for the first time.</li>
										<li>Always let someone know where you are going. Provide the name and address of the student you are going to visit.</li>
										<li>Always plan your route to your student's home. Make sure you know the directions to where your student lives.</li>
										<li>Closely monitor the environment of your student's home.</li>
										<li>Gather as much information about the student/parent as you can. Apart from compensation, it's a good practice to figure out whether you are feeling safe and comfortable or not in teaching at their home, their location and the given timings.</li>
										<li>Always notify your parents/family members about your tutoring time and the time you expect to return.</li>
										<li>If you find any uncomfortable issue, it is advisable to terminate the student from your tutoring services right away.</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>
									At the end, trust your instincts during phone calls and meetings and if you don't feel comfortable about the people, location or surroundings, either do double check or avoid getting into uncomfortable situations which may potentially seem unsafe.
